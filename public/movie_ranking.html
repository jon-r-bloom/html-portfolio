<h3>1. Kingdom Hearts</h3>
<p>A series that can be played by all ages, this story not only incorporates fantastic gameplay and action sequences, but also teaches the true meaning and benefits of friendship, all while fighting alongside your favorite Disney characters.</p>
<h3>2. The Legend of Zelda</h3>
<p>Another game that can be enjoied by multiple age groups, although some games may have scary images. Large play area with multiple side quests and an always intreaguing story.</p>
<h3>3. Mass Effect</h3>
<p>While only spanning three games, this series allows for a high level of customization in character looks and abilities, as well as an ability to control the ethics of the main character. Very intreaguing story line, however the ending leves much to be desired.</p>
